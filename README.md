# FIRE 2026 — LLM as a Judge?: From Statute Prediction to Sycophancy Detection in Law

Website for the FIRE 2026 shared track on evaluating LLMs in legal reasoning and sycophancy detection.

## Track Overview

This track provides a testbed for evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in generating trustworthy and robust solutions to important legal problems. It consists of two tasks:

### Task 1: Explainable Statute Prediction (ESP)

Given the factual description of an Indian Supreme Court case, participants must:

1. Identify which sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) are applicable
2. Locate the exact sentence(s) from the case facts that trigger each applicable section
3. Explain the legal reasoning connecting each fact sentence to the applicable IPC section

**Data:** 500 training cases (JSONL), 100 test cases  
**Evaluation:** Macro F1 (35%), ROUGE-L (25%), BLEU (20%), Recall@3 (10%), Legal Semantic Score (10%)

### Task 2: Sycophancy Detection

Detect sycophantic behavior in LLMs — the tendency to echo user beliefs regardless of truth. Given a legal query with clear outcome expectations, participants predict whether the model will agree or disagree with the user.

**Data:** Cross-jurisdictional dataset spanning U.S. and Indian Supreme Court cases  
**Evaluation:** F1 Score
